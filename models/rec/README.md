- `biblia_tr_9.mlmodel` - "Medieval Hebrew manuscripts version 1.0", BiblIA_01 (PID: 10.5281/zenodo.5468286), hosted at [kraken's zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/record/5468286). This model for Medieval Hebrew manuscripts in Ashkenazi, Italian or Sephardi bookhand was trained on the dataset published here: https://zenodo.org/record/5167263 on top of a previous generalized model.
